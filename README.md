## Overview

KarmaPurge is a bot-protection API for shortlinks and gated flows. It detects and blocks VPNs, proxies, data-center IPs, TOR, headless browsers, and common scraping tools in real time. Integrate it at the "pre-click" or "pre-redirect" step to keep paid traffic and funnels clean.

---

## Key Features

- **IP Intelligence** – Detects VPNs, proxies, datacenters, and TOR using real‑time data sources.
- **User‑Agent Filtering** – Blocks known scrapers, headless browsers, and automation frameworks.
- **Geo & Device Rules** – Allow/block by country, device type, or ISP.
- **Rate Limit Management** – Configure limits per key/route from the dashboard.
- **Webhooks** – Receive real‑time events for allows/blocks.
- **Custom Rules (Enterprise)** – Tailor filters, lists, add whitelisted/blacklisted ips, logic to your stack and many more.

---

## How It Works

KarmaPurge combines **known VPN/proxy IP ranges**, **ASN databases**, **user‑agent heuristics**, and **behavioral analysis**. Pro/Enterprise plans add **geo‑IP**, **device‑type**, and **ISP** filtering.

Infrastructure runs on global edge networks for low‑latency detection and high uptime. SLAs available for Enterprise.

---

## Quickstart

1. **Create an account** and obtain an **API key**.
2. **Call the check endpoint** before redirecting users to your destination link.
3. **Allow or block** based on the response (e.g., `bot/vpn/proxy/human`).

### Minimal cURL

```bash
curl -i \
  -H "x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "x-visitor-ip-asli: <CLIENT_IP>" \
  "https://karmapurge.shop/api/whoami/v1/[yourshortlinkkey]"
```

### Node.js (fetch)

```js
const res = await fetch(
	"https://karmapurge.shop/api/whoami/v1/[yourshortlinkkey]",
	{
		headers: {
			"x-api-key": karmapurge_api_key,
			// If you sit behind a proxy/load balancer, forward the real client IP
			"x-visitor-ip-asli": clientIp,
		},
	}
);
const verdict = await res.json();
if (verdict.allow) {
	// proceed with redirect
} else {
	// show block page or alternate flow
}
```

### PHP

```php
$ch = curl_init("https://karmapurge.shop/api/whoami/v1/[yourshortlinkkey]");
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
  "x-api-key: $yourkarmapurgeapikey",
  "x-visitor-ip-asli: $clientIp"
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
$body = json_decode($response, true);
if ($body['allow']) {
  // redirect
} else {
  // block
}
```

> **Note**: If your integration runs at the edge or the origin with direct client access, you can omit `x-visitor-ip-asli`. The service will use the request IP.

## API Reference

### `/api/whoami/v1/[yourshortlinkkey]`

**Method:** `GET` or `POST`\
**Auth:** Header `x-api-key: <key>`\
**Client IP:** Automatically detected; optionally pass `x-visitor-ip-asli` when behind proxies/CDNs.

**Query/body parameters (optional):**

- `ua` – Override the detected User‑Agent for testing.
- `country` – Override country (testing only).
- `device` – Override device type (testing only).

**Headers:**

- `x-api-key` _(required)_ – Your API key.
- `x-visitor-ip-asli` _(recommended)_ – End‑user IP if you’re behind a proxy.
- `User-Agent` _(recommended)_ – Aids heuristic detection.

**Response:** JSON object with allow/deny verdict and context (see examples below).

## Rate Limits

- Limits are configurable per key on paid plans.
- Burst protection and dashboard management are provided.
- On limit exceed, expect `429 Too Many Requests` with a JSON error payload.

**Error payload example**

```json
{
	"error": "rate_limited",
	"retryAfter": 60
}
```

---

## Webhooks

- Subscribe from the dashboard to receive **allow/deny** events.
- Typical payload includes request ID, IP, UA, geo, verdict, and matched rules.
- Use webhooks to sync logs/analytics or trigger automated actions.
